# What Is My Weather?

## Description

This frontend application is a revamped version of our vanilla JS weather dashboard! This time the app has been completely redone using [React](https://react.dev/) and uses [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) to handle API calls. Weather data was obtained from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api).

## Usage

Below is an example of how a user would interact with this web application.

## Future Considerations

In the future, improvements to this app would include a backend that would hold sensitive data like API keys.
